  <h1>About FreshJuice</h1>

  <p>
    FreshJuice started with a simple idea: to create a HubSpot CMS theme that feels
    fresh, lightweight, and truly useful for marketers, designers, and developers alike.
    Built with clean code and modern design principles, it’s more than a theme —
    it’s a foundation for building standout web experiences.
  </p>

  <p>
    Behind FreshJuice is <strong><a href="/authors/reatlat/">Alex Zappa</a></strong>,
    the Founder and Software Engineer who has worked on dozens of HubSpot projects and custom themes.
    With this experience came the vision for a theme that is simple, fast, and crafted with care.
    That’s why the <strong>FreshJuice Developer Edition</strong> remains open-source — we believe tools
    should be accessible, transparent, and shaped by a community that shares ideas and contributes improvements.
  </p>

  <p>
    Today, FreshJuice is growing into both a <strong>studio</strong> and a <strong>growing family of products</strong>.
    Alongside the free theme, we’re developing premium PRO modules and features designed for marketers and non-coders —
    making it easier to launch campaigns, publish content, and experiment without technical barriers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our philosophy is simple: <em>stay fresh, stand out, and make a lasting impression online.</em>
    We’ve shared more about this vision in <a href="/blog/our-philosophy/">Our Philosophy</a>,
    where we explain why FreshJuice was created and what drives our approach to building themes.
