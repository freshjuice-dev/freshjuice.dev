Aspiring software engineer in the making. Currently studying computer science and sharpening skills in software engineering. I enjoy exploring logic through chess, puzzles, and coding challenges, while also diving into video games as a way to spark new ideas. Always curious, always learning, and driven to build the tools of tomorrow.
