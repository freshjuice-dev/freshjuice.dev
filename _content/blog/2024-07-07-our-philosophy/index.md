In my opinion, there is no such thing as an ideal theme until you define it for a specific individual project.

I don't like themes that are like Swiss Army knives, with all-in-one. The theme should be created for a specific project and should not contain anything extra.

Unfortunately, almost all themes in the HubSpot Marketplace are like Swiss Army knives. They can do everything, but they are difficult to learn and use.

Websites built on such themes always contain a lot of clutter, third-party libraries, and they always run slowly. I won't even mention that styles on such websites vary from page to page.

From years of experience working on themes for HubSpot, I have come to the conclusion that an ideal theme should be simple, lightweight, fast, and contain minimal code. Users should not have a multitude of settings that they don't even understand.

The theme should adhere to the style guide and not give users too much power to break it.

In other words, the ideal theme should be like a Rubik's cube, simple and complex at the same time. The end user should not have to think about how to configure a module as they did on another page. Businesses do not need bootstrap's like solutions. They need a simple and fast solution that will help them achieve their goals.

The theme should be like Lego bricks, where each module is a separate brick that can be used in different projects.

It is precisely because I got tired of seeing very poor migrations on HubSpot that I decided to create my own theme, which will be simple, lightweight, fast, and contain minimal code.

FreshJuice can serve as both a starting theme and be fully customized to meet the needs of the project.

If you want to try FreshJuice, you can install it on your HubSpot account completely for free. To do this, go to the [installation page](/docs/installation/).
