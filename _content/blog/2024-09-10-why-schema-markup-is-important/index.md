In this article, we will delve into the fundamentals of schema markup, explore its evolution, and discuss why it plays a pivotal role in enhancing your SEO strategy. From its origins to the benefits it offers, this guide will help you grasp why implementing schema markup is a must for optimizing your website’s performance.

## What is the schema markup in SEO?

Schema markup, also known as structured data, is a type of vocabulary or microdata that’s added to the HTML of a website to help [search engines](/blog/top-4-best-search-engines-of-2024/) understand better the content of the page or article.

It was developed by an open collaborative community called Schema.org, launched in 2011. That community was founded by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex with the main goal of creating a universal standard for structured data to simplify and unify how websites communicate with search engines. Before 2011, different formats and vocabularies existed (RDFa, Microformats, etc.), making it challenging not only for search engines to rank content but also for webmasters as each search engine had its preferred structured data format.

The creation of Schema.org by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Yandex aimed to address these issues by providing a single, comprehensive, and consistent vocabulary for structured data. This initiative allowed for better standardization, making it easier for websites to implement structured data and for search engines to interpret and utilize it effectively.

### Does Schema Markup Help SEO?

Yes, it does. As mentioned before, schema markup was created by an initiative founded by some of the most important search engine companies like Google and Yandex, because they needed a unified vocabulary to understand better the published content and, therefore, rank the content better. In fact, when looking for the primary goals of this vocabulary, there are three:

1) Help search engines better understand the content of web pages by providing a standardized format for information.
1) Rank pages more effectively based on relevance and context.
1) Ensure consistency in how structured data is represented across different search engines, making it easier for webmasters

So, yes, every time you implement schema markup in your content, you are helping search engines understand it better and enhance your SEO efforts.

## Why Schema Markup Is Important?

As mentioned before, the reason why schema markup is important is that it is crucial to help search engines understand the content you publish on your website. When search engines can accurately interpret your content, they can deliver more relevant search results and present richer snippets to users. This clarity can significantly impact your site’s performance in search engine results pages (most commonly known as SERPs).

Besides helping you improve SERP visibility, schema markup has other benefits that can also have a positive impact on your website and, therefore, its SEO. These are some of those benefits:

- **Better Click-Through Rates:** Rich snippets and enhanced search results that use schema markup often attract more attention from users. The additional details, such as star ratings, prices, or event times, can make your content stand out, leading to higher click-through rates (CTR) and potentially more traffic to your site.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** By providing clear and structured information directly in the search results, schema markup improves the user experience. Users can find the information they need quickly without having to click through multiple search results, which can lead to increased satisfaction and engagement.
- **Increased Visibility and Discoverability:** Schema markup can help your content appear in various rich features like knowledge panels, carousels, and answer boxes (people love this and webmasters are always trying to get them!). This increased visibility can lead to a broader audience and more opportunities for user engagement.
- **Improved Search Engine Understanding:** As we have already mentioned multiple times in this article, schema markup helps search engines understand the context of your content, which can improve the accuracy of search results and rankings. It provides additional context that helps search engines better match your content with relevant search queries.
- **Enhanced Local SEO:** For businesses with physical locations, schema markup can improve local SEO by providing search engines with detailed information about your business, such as address, phone number, and operating hours. This can help improve local search visibility and attract nearby customers.

In other words, implementing schema markup is not just about making your content more accessible to search engines but also about enhancing how users interact with your search results.

What Is the Recommended Format for Implementing Schema Markup?
When deciding the format for implementing schema markup, you’ll see that there are three main formats to choose from: JSON-LD, Microdata, and RDFa. Each format has its own method for embedding structured data, and the choice often depends on your preferences and requirements.

However, the recommended format is usually JSON-LD (JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data). Why? Well, because it is easy to use and maintain, has a non-intrusive nature (for example, regarding the performance of the page) and it’s less prone to user errors among other benefits.

In fact, Google usually recommends JSON-LD because ([in their own words](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/intro-structured-data?hl=es#:~:text=In%20general%2C%20Google%20recommends%20using,less%20prone%20to%20user%20errors)): “it’s the easiest solution for website owners to implement and maintain at scale.”
