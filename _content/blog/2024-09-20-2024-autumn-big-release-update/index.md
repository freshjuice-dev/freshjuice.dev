We are proud to announce a big update for FreshJuice! The theme is now on its [second major release](https://github.com/freshjuice-dev/freshjuice-hubspot-theme/releases/tag/v2.0.0), using a fresh [MIT licence](https://github.com/freshjuice-dev/freshjuice-hubspot-theme/blob/main/LICENSE). Game-changing news for devs!

**Attention to all developers!** FreshJuice so far, since its release, has been using the [GPLv3 licence](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html). However, we've wanted to give devs and users of our product more freedom when it comes to modifying and updating it for themselves. Therefore, we have switched to the [MIT licence](https://mit-license.org/).

This allows devs to do things such as:

- Use, copy and modify the software.
- Distribute modified and unmodified versions of the software.
- Including the software in commercial products or services.

You may find [more information about it here](https://github.com/freshjuice-dev/freshjuice-hubspot-theme/blob/main/README.md)

## Modules

We have updated many of our modules. They are now more simplified and are easier to modify. Modules updated by this were the following:
- [Social Icons](/docs/modules/social-icons/)
- [Pricing Cards](/docs/modules/pricing-cards/)
- [Card](/docs/modules/card/)
- [List](/docs/modules/list/)
- [Button](/docs/modules/button/)
- All Testimonials Modules
- All Statistics Modules

Additionally, we have a new module joining our FreshJuice family; The Flip Cards Module.

This module enables you to add a simple three columns layout made up of maximum three cards. When a card is hovered over, the card will rotate 180Â°, showing the content behind the card.

More details about this module in the [Flip Cards documentation](/docs/modules/flip-cards/).

## Sections

We have updated our Cards section.

## Documentation
