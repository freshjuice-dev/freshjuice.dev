## First things first: what is SEO?

If you’re somehow new to this idea, you may be struggling to understand what exactly does SEO mean. Firstly, these are the initials for “Search Engine Optimization”, which includes a long list of strategies which we mentioned before and will study in more detail afterwards. Therefore, SEO involves the optimization of a website’s content, structure and technical aspects in order to improve its visibility in search engine results like Google. When implementing these SEO optimization strategies, you’ll be trying to rank higher for relevant search queries and driving more unpaid traffic to the site.

A good example of this practice would be the use of keywords; if you have a post that focuses on “benefits of eating cranberries”, for instance, you should be identifying if that title is a popular and relevant keyword and then use it in the title, headings and within the content.

## SEO strategies for success

Now it’s the time for you to pick up notes and then implement the SEO optimization strategies on your website after we have explained some of the more important and effective ones. Although you don’t necessarily need to use all of them, the truth is that we could safely stand by “the more, the merrier” when it comes to SEO strategies. Let’s have a look at some of them!

### Keyword research

As we were explaining before, one of the main strategies every blog or site should have implemented is the keywords research. You already know what it consists of identify relevant keywords and phrases that potential customers use to search for content related to your business. Okay, but how can you do this keywords research? Some of our suggestions are Google Keyword Planner, Ahrefs or SEMrush, which will help you find high-volume, low-competition keywords.

Once you’re familiar with this keyword research and know how to select the best ones for your content, you’ll start learning one thing or two about how search engines work. This happens because keywords research helps you understand what your target audience is searching for, so that you can start creating content which addresses their needs and having a great SEO optimization of your site.

### On-Page Optimization

Once we have a list of the keywords we should be using on our website for the search engines to notice it faster and on a higher position, we should be using those keywords everywhere. This is part of the On-Page Optimization SEO strategy, which encourages us to include targeted keywords in titles, headings, meta descriptions, URL slugs and within the content itself. We don’t want to be ableist, so we also will be implementing alt text on images and ensuring content is well-structured and user-friendly.

This will result in an improvement on the relevance and clarity of our pages not only for users, but also for search engines. That achieved, then our site will be ranked higher and have an increased visibility and more organic traffic.

### Link Building

Have you ever noticed the presence of links in the posts you read? You may or may not pay attention to that, but we promise you search engines do. When you acquire links from other reputable websites you’re increasing your own site’s authority, but how can you achieve that? Hard work will pay off, so you should start guest posting, outreaching to industry influencers, creating shareable content or simply earning links naturally because your content is worthy.

### Technical SEO

If your goal is to be indexable by search engines, you need to take special care of the technical aspects of your website. This can be done by optimizing the site’s speed, making sure it’s mobile-friendly — let’s not forget the chances of someone reading your post with their phone — and fixing broken links or implementing structured data.

If you manage to have all these technical aspects in your website (or hire someone who can take care of them) you’ll be one step closer to SEO optimization and having your site on the first search engines results.

### Content freshness

Last, but not least, there’s nothing timeless nowadays but tons of information spreading every day at every hour and getting out-of-style faster than ever. What can you do to prevent your site from becoming outdated? Exactly what in SEO optimization is known as “content freshness”, which consists of keeping your content relevant and up-to-date. Having a regularly updated content will more likely attract visitors (new and old ones) and earn new backlinks, which will definitely boost your overall SEO performance.

As you may have noticed, SEO optimization strategies are a continuous learning and you can never relax when it comes to your site presence on the internet. There will always be new strategies or techniques that will be potentially good for your business, so make sure you bring yourself up to date every once in a while.

Finally, and before you run to implement the SEO optimization strategies we’ve been talking about — even though there’s many more you can look into —, always remember what your content is about, what do you want to tell your audience and what are the results you’re expecting from your website. SEO optimization and strategies will only be useful if you have a clear mind about your goals.
