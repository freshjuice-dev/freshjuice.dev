HubSpot Analytics will help you identify whether your site is a high-performing one or, otherwise, needs some improvement. This is evaluated from factors such as page views, CTA click-through rates and SEO recommendations for obtaining a better performance.
- **SEO Recommendations.** Running out of ideas? Don’t worry, you can get actionable tips to improve your website’s SEO and, therefore, your sales or audience goals. You’ll benefit from a scan that focuses on possible issues on meta descriptions, broken links or even slow [page speeds](/blog/page-speed-and-seo-2024/) which may be causing a bad positioning or small public.
- **Integration with CRM.** Last, but not least, HubSpot’s unique feature is its integration with your CRM — which can be HubSpot itself. Thanks to this, you’ll be able to track how organic traffic turns into leads, opportunities and customers, essential for identifying your SEO’s ROI.
