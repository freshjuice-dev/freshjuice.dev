In this article, we’ll tackle all your questions about testimonials—why they’re a game-changer for your website, how to use them effectively, and additional tips to help you make the most of them (trust us, you’ll want to stick around). Let’s dive in!

## What Are Testimonials or Endorsements?

Let’s start with the basics. Testimonials or endorsements are statements from customers or clients sharing their experiences with your product or service. These can range from glowing praise to constructive criticism. While positive testimonials highlight what people love about your brand, even negative ones can provide valuable insights or show how you handle feedback professionally.

Whether it’s a short quote, an in-depth review, or a video, testimonials **help build trust and demonstrate transparency**, showing potential customers that you value all feedback and use it to improve.

Many people believe that adding testimonials can be a double-edged sword since they showcase both positive and negative opinions. However, as we mentioned earlier, they can help build trust with potential clients—and trust often translates into sales.

## Why I Should Use Testimonials on My Website

So, coming back to your question: “Should I use testimonials or endorsements on my website?” The answer is still yes, even though you risk receiving a few negative reviews. But why? Well, we have our reasons to recommend it.

- **It’s sketchy not having testimonials.** Before buying any product online, we all check the reviews—that’s a fact. And when we don’t find testimonials, we start to suspect that the product might not be as good as the brand claims. Testimonials provide potential customers with reassurance that your product or service has been tested and approved by others. Without them, your site may feel less trustworthy—or even suspicious, as if you’re hiding something.
- **They build credibility.** As we have mentioned before, testimonials act as social proof, showing that real people have had positive (or constructive) experiences with your brand. This kind of authenticity builds confidence in new customers who might still be on the fence.
- **They can boost conversions.** When people see others sharing their success stories, they’re more likely to take the leap and make a purchase. Testimonials reduce hesitation and encourage action, directly impacting your sales.

- Even if there’s some constructive criticism in the mix, it’s an opportunity to show how your brand handles feedback and values improvement—which only strengthens your reputation. So yes, testimonials are a must-have!

## Where and How to Add Testimonials to My Website?

If we’ve convinced you to add testimonials to your website, the next step is learning how and where to implement them.

### How to Add testimonials to My Website?

There are plenty of options for adding testimonials to your website, and some are easier than others. While you can create a self-made testimonial system where clients can leave reviews directly on your website, there’s another method we think is better for SEO. We’ll explain both options so you can choose the one that works best for you.

1. **A self-made testimonial system.** A self-made testimonial system lets you gather and display reviews directly on your website. You can set up a form where clients submit their feedback, and once approved, it gets posted on your site. This approach gives you full control over the design and content, but it can be time-consuming to manage. Also, you’ll need to moderate the submissions to ensure they’re authentic and relevant.
2. **Using a reliable third-party platform and using a plugin to add the testimonials.** Alternatively, using a third-party platform for testimonials can simplify the process and improve SEO. Platforms like [Google Reviews](https://support.google.com/business/answer/7091?sjid=17245648693029887031-EU#zippy=%2Cmanage-respond-to-reviews), Trustpilot, or [Yelp](https://www.linkgraph.com/blog/yelp-seo/) allow customers to leave reviews on their sites, which can then be integrated into your website using a plugin. This method is great for boosting SEO because these platforms are trusted by search engines, and their reviews can contribute to your site’s authority. Plus, it’s easier to manage and scale as your business grows.

### Where to Add the Testimonials?

This will depend on your criteria and the structure of your site. Some people prefer to have a dedicated page for testimonials and endorsements, while others choose to add a section on their homepage or at the end of each product or service page.

If your brand is already well-known or gaining traction, we recommend **creating a dedicated testimonials page**. This can help establish a unique branded keyword for clients specifically searching for your brand’s testimonials. However, if your website is new and you don’t yet have many testimonials or widespread recognition, it’s perfectly fine to **include a testimonials section wherever it fits best** (on your homepage, product pages, etc.) And, always conduct A/B testing to determine the best placement for your site.

That said, if you’re [working with landing pages](/blog/key-components-persuasive-landing-page/) for paid campaigns like Google Ads or Facebook Ads, we strongly recommend adding a testimonials section. This will 100% help you boost your click-through rate (CTR).

### How Many Testimonials to Include on My Website?

At the beginning, this will depend more on the quantity of testimonials you have than what you want. But as soon as you gather enough, we recommend adding as many as possible. To do this without making your clients scroll for half an hour to reach the end of the page, design the testimonials section to show only 4 to 5 at a time, with a button to display the rest gradually. And if you can order them from best to worst, even better.

## What Keyword Should You Use on the Testimonials Page on a Website?

If you have listened to us and have follow every step of this article but you are now working on the [SEO strategy](/blog/seo-optimization-for-search-engines/) you are probably wondering “what keyword should I use on testimonials page on website”.

If you’ve decided to create a separate page for testimonials or endorsements, the next step is choosing the right keyword. Start by checking if your brand already has a relevant testimonial keyword. For example, try searching for “[your brand’s name] + review.” If that keyword already exists, you can use it. If not, use one following a similar structure: “[your brand’s name] + review,” “[your brand’s name] + reviews,” “[your brand’s name] + testimonials,” or even “[your brand’s name] + [product’s name] + review.”

As your brand grows, this is likely the type of search potential clients will use when looking for reviews or testimonials in [search engines](/blog/top-4-best-search-engines-of-2024/).
