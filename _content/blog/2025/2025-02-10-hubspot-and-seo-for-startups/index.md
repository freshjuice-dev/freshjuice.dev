## 2️⃣ Long-Tail Keywords

Whether you know about SEO strategies or not, you must have heard about keywords and their significance when it comes to having a strong presence online. Nowadays, with large brands and companies dominating the internet, it can be difficult to rank for highly competitive keywords, so startups should then focus on long-tail keywords, which are niche phrases with lower competition but higher intent.

Let’s set an example: instead of using a keyword like “marketing software”, aim for something more like “affordable marketing software for small businesses”. Again, with HubSpot’s keyword research tool you’ll find it easy to get ideas and study volume, competition level or related terms.

## 3️⃣ Content That Converts

Okay, so what if you don’t know what to write about on your website? This can absolutely happen, specially if you’re more of a business person — or group of people — rather than a creative one. This is what HubSpot’s content strategy was created for, a tool with which you’ll be able not only to create content, but also optimize it so that it ranks on search engines. Any website aiming for first positions should have blog posts, landing pages and pillar content that can answer its clients’ questions and doubts.

Based on your keywords research, HubSpot will help you plan topics and ensure you include meta descriptions, have optimized headings and add internal — and external — links. If you manage to keep publishing SEO-optimized content, you’ll have a startup with authority and organic traffic over time.

## 4️⃣ Technical SEO Issues

Let’s say you now have a website that includes posts, landing pages and pillar content and you’ve taken care of SEO strategies, but what about those issues we tend to overlook? For example, have you ever visited an extremely slow site that has made you abandon it immediately? This is what we’re talking about here.

When creating a website for our business, we tend to overlook issues like broken links, slow page speeds and poor mobile optimization, which can hurt your rankings monumentally. HubSpot has a site audit tool that will scan your website searching for this kind of techical issues and will provide a detailed report so that you can take action and fix them. Missing alt text? Found it. Duplicated content? Found it.
