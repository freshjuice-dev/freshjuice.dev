## Editorial Standards

### 1. Content Integrity

- We will not alter the author’s core opinions or arguments.
- Only light edits for grammar, spelling, readability, and formatting may be applied.

### 2. Attribution & Author Information

- **Anonymous submissions will not be accepted.**
- Every submission must include:
  - Author’s **full name**.
  - A valid **email address** for editorial contact (will not be publicly shared).
  - Optional: professional title, company, LinkedIn profile, or personal website.
- A short author bio will appear at the bottom of each article with 1–2 links to the author’s website, social media, or portfolio.

### 3. Backlink Policy

- Articles may include backlinks to the author’s own website or resources, but only when **relevant to the content**.
- Submissions with excessive or unrelated links will be rejected.
- Affiliate links, spammy directories, or paid placements are not allowed.

### 4. Submission Review

- All submissions will be reviewed for:
  - Relevance to marketing, SEO, branding, or digital growth.

  - Originality — we do not accept plagiarized or AI-spun content.
  - Respectful tone (no discriminatory, misleading, or harmful language).
- Articles may be rejected if they fail to meet these standards.
