## Editorial Standards

### 1. Content Integrity

- We will not alter the author’s core opinions or arguments.
- Only light edits for grammar, spelling, readability, and formatting may be applied.

### 2. Attribution & Author Information

    - On the website, the name will link to the author’s profile page, which lists all their contributions on FreshJuice.
  - A valid **email address**.
    - Required for editorial contact and for generating profile images via [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com).
    - Your email will not be published on the FreshJuice website, and you may request removal of your data at any time.
  - Optional: professional title, company name, LinkedIn profile, or personal website.
- **Author bio placement:**
  - A short bio will appear at the bottom of each article, together with the author’s name (linked to their FreshJuice profile) and a company mention `@ CompanyName` that links to the author’s organization or website.
  - The author’s profile page will include a longer bio and up to 5 links, which may include:
    - The author’s personal website or portfolio.
    - Social media profiles.
    - The website or LinkedIn page of the company they represent.

### 3. Backlink Policy

### 4. Submission Review

  - Respectful tone (no discriminatory, misleading, or harmful language).
- Articles may be rejected if they fail to meet these standards.

### 5. Disclaimer

- Every guest post will include a disclaimer such as:
