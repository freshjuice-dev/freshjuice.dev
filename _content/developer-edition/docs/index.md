## Welcome to the FreshJuice Developer Edition Documentation

The **Developer Edition** is the free, open-source version of the FreshJuice theme ‚Äî built for developers who love to build, customize, and experiment üçä
This documentation will guide you through installation, configuration, and the technical foundations behind the theme.

Check out the [Knowledge Base](/docs/) ‚Äî that‚Äôs where the upcoming **FreshJuice Pro Theme** and advanced **Pro Modules** live.

## Frameworks we use

FreshJuice is built with the following frameworks:

- [Tailwind CSS](/developer-edition/docs/tailwindcss/), works by scanning all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and any other templates for class names, generating the corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file.
- [Alpine.js](/developer-edition/docs/alpinejs/), a rugged, minimal tool for composing behavior directly in your markup. Think of it like jQuery for the modern web.

## Browser Support

In general, FreshJuice theme is designed for and tested on the latest stable versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari. It does not support any version of IE, including IE 11.
