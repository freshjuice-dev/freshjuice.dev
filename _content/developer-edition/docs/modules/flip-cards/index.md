Flip Cards Module is a three column layout made up of cards.
Each card has two sides to them, so when hovered on a card, the card will do a 180Â° rotation to reveal the other side of the card.

## Settings

- **Flip Cards List**: Contains all your flip cards (maximum amount of them is 3). Every Flip Card has the following settings:
  - **Avatar**: Your Image of choice for the flip card avatar.
  - **Title**: Main Title of the flip card.
  - **Second Title**: Additional information text.
  - **Card Details**: Secondary row of information text.
  - **Description**: The content on the other side of the flip card. It is revealed when the user hovers over your flip card. All the other content remains hidden behind so only description will be seen on hover.
