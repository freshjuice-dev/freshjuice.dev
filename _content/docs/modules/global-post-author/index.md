The Global Post Author module allows you to display a card at the end of the blog post with the author's details and their headshot

You can see this module in action [here](https://143910617.hs-sites-eu1.com/blog/tangy-and-nutrient-packed-orange-spinach-salad)

This module has no settings and uses all data from the authors you add into the theme. Whoever made the post, is from whom the data will be used in this module.
