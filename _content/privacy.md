Your privacy matters to us. This notice explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights under GDPR and other applicable laws.

## Who we are (Data Controller)

**FreshJuice** — an independent project and brand operated by a single developer.
For any privacy inquiries, please contact: **privacy@freshjuice.dev**

If you are in the EEA/UK, FreshJuice is the **data controller** for personal data collected via this Website.

## What we collect

We collect:

- **Usage data** (pages viewed, referrers, device, country, browser/OS).
- **Contact data** if you submit a form (name, email, company, message).
- **Support/sales communications** (messages you send us).

We do **not** collect special category data.

---

## Legal bases (GDPR)

We process data on:

- **Consent** — for non-essential cookies/marketing cookies (HubSpot).
- **Legitimate interests** — to run analytics that respect privacy (Plausible), prevent abuse, improve the site.
- **Contract** — when you request a demo, quote or support.
- **Legal obligations** — when we must keep records.

## Cookies & tracking

### Essential cookies

We use essential cookies required for the site to function (e.g., security, load balancing). These do not require consent.

### HubSpot tracking (consent-based)

We use **HubSpot** for forms, CRM and site analytics/automation. HubSpot may set cookies and track interactions (page views, form submissions). Non-essential HubSpot cookies load **only after your consent** via our cookie banner/preferences.

- HubSpot privacy: <https://legal.hubspot.com/privacy-policy>

You can change your choice anytime via the **Cookie settings** link in the footer (or your browser settings).

### Privacy-friendly analytics (no cookies)

We run a **self-hosted Plausible Analytics** instance (servers in Germany). It does **not** use cookies and does **not** collect personal data. Plausible records only aggregated, anonymized metrics (page URL, referrer, device, country, etc.).

- Plausible data policy: <https://plausible.io/data-policy>

### Embedded third-party content

Some pages embed third-party media which may set their own cookies:

- **YouTube** (we use privacy-enhanced mode where possible) — <https://policies.google.com/privacy>
- **Vimeo** — <https://vimeo.com/privacy>
- **CodePen** — <https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/privacy-policy/#cookies>

When feasible, embeds load only after interaction (click-to-play) or after your consent.

## Forms & communications

If you submit a form or contact us, we process your details to respond and keep a record of the conversation (HubSpot CRM). We may send you service emails related to your request. Marketing emails are sent only with your consent and include an **Unsubscribe** link.

---

## Data sharing

We do not sell your personal data. We share limited data with:

- **Service providers (processors)** — hosting, HubSpot CRM, email delivery, error monitoring; all under data processing agreements.
- **Legal authorities** — only when required by law.

Some providers may be outside the EEA/UK. Where applicable, we use appropriate safeguards (e.g., EU SCCs).

---

## Retention

- **Form/contact data**: up to **24 months** from your last interaction (or earlier upon request).
- **CRM records**: while you are an active lead/client and as required by law.
- **Analytics (Plausible)**: only aggregated, non-personal data.

We delete or anonymize data when no longer needed.

---

## Your rights (EEA/UK)

You can request:

- access, correction, deletion;
- restriction or objection to processing;
- portability (where applicable);
- withdrawal of consent (for HubSpot non-essential cookies/marketing) at any time, without affecting prior lawful processing.

To exercise your rights: email **privacy@freshjuice.dev**. You also have the right to complain to your local data protection authority.

---

## International transfers

Where data is transferred outside the EEA/UK (e.g., HubSpot infrastructure), we rely on lawful transfer mechanisms (e.g., EU Standard Contractual Clauses) and implement additional safeguards where necessary.

---

## Security

We use technical and organizational measures to protect your data (encryption in transit, access controls, least-privilege, logging). No method is 100% secure; we will notify you and regulators of breaches when legally required.

---
