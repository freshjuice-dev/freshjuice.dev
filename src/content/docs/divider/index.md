The Divider module is a simple module that allows you to add a horizontal line to your page. This module is useful for separating different sections of your page or to add a visual break between different elements.

Optionally, you may just disable the horizontal line and use the module as a spacer.

## Settings
- **Show Divider?**:(Toggle) When enabled, the module will display a horizontal line.
- **Spacing**:(Slider) The height difference from the page content and the horizontal line. The default value is 50, therefore the line will have 50px top and bottom of the horizontal line. When show divider is toggled off, the spacing becomes a spacer.
- **Anchor ID**: The ID of the divider. This is useful for linking to a specific section of the page. The default value is divider.
